‚úÖ TASK 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
A simple chatbot implemented in `chattie_gui.py`, which responds to user inputs based on predefined rules hardcoded within the application.
‚úÖ TASK 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
An artificial intelligence agent implemented in `tictactoe_gui.py`, designed to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player.
The AI uses the **minimax algorithm** (without alpha-beta pruning), with options to toggle between **unbeatable AI** and **random moves**.
‚úÖ TASK 3: Movie Recommendation System
A content-based movie recommender system implemented in `app.py`, utilizing movie metadata to suggest similar titles.
This system uses datasets sourced from Kaggle.
**Note:** Due to large file size constraints, the CSV files (`movies.csv`, `credits.csv`, etc.) are **not uploaded** to this repository. Please download them separately from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) and place them in the appropriate directory before running the application.
