🎓 CODSOFT Internship Projects – Artificial Intelligence
Welcome to my Artificial Intelligence Internship Projects Repository as part of the CodSoft Internship Program. This repository contains the implementations of the three tasks I completed during the internship, focusing on building real-world AI applications with Python.
📁 Projects in This Repository
✅ TASK 1: Rule-Based Chatbot (`chattie_gui.py`)
A simple chatbot with a GUI built using `tkinter`.
Features:
* Responds to user input based on a predefined intent dictionary
* Simulates typing delay and includes basic memory (e.g., remembers your name)
* Detects keywords to reply with relevant messages
* Provides greetings, jokes, time, emotional support, and more
💡 A simple introduction to natural language processing concepts through rule-based logic.

✅ TASK 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game (`tictactoe_gui.py`)
An AI agent plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player in this GUI-based game.
Features:
* Built with `tkinter`
* Supports two AI difficulty levels:
  * Unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm
  * Random AI for easier gameplay
* Detects win/loss/draw and allows game restart
🧠 A practical way to learn game theory and search algorithms.

✅ TASK 3: Movie Recommendation System (`app.py`)

A content-based movie recommendation system built with `Streamlit`.
Features:
* Uses TF-IDF and SVD for text vectorization and dimensionality reduction
* Employs Nearest Neighbors to find similar movies
* User-friendly UI to:
  * Search movies
  * Filter by genre (if available)
  * Get personalized recommendations
⚠️ **Note:** The required dataset (`clean_movies_dataset.csv`) is not included in this repo.
Please download it from [Kaggle TMDB Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) or prepare your own version with columns like `title`, `genre`, and `content`.

🚀 How to Run Each Project
 1. Chatbot (`chattie_gui.py`)

```bash
python chattie_gui.py
```

2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI (`tictactoe_gui.py`)

```bash
python tictactoe_gui.py
```

3. Movie Recommender (`app.py`)

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn numpy
streamlit run app.py
```

Ensure you place `clean_movies_dataset.csv` in the same directory as `app.py`.
